At higher levels of performance, an emission management plan evaluates risk and aligns to the local landscape, community, and environmental ecosystems. ","This indicator measures the commitment to monitoring GHG emissions for the climate impact area as a part of adaptive management. Emissions are monitored based off of scope one, two, and three emissions as well as widely accepted accounting methodologies, specialists, remediation actions with SMART targets, and third-party verification of monitoring. The overarching goal of this indicator is to account for monitoring of all emissions as to reduce and ultimately eliminate them from the value chain. This indicator is distinct from other monitoring indicators for other impacts areas due to the non-use of the PSR framework. This decision was made due to the need to be focused on emission-specific monitoring here.","This indicator examines the level of ambition that a program takes toward GHG emissions as a true priority area. In particular, this indicator looks at ambition in relation to expansion and intensification, definition and explanation of why GHG emissions matter, continuous improvement to reductions in emissions, and positive/net gain outcomes.","This indicator evaluates the implementation of decarbonization methods to support the transition to lower carbon fiber production.

At present, the textile sector and scientific community, at large, have yet to align behind a standardized methodology for measuring and accounting for carbon sequestration. As such, it is not currently possible to apply a consistent quantitative analysis of carbon sequestered in specific fiber programs. Regional and site-specific differences also limit our ability to assess programs for their overall sequestration. This indicator encourages ongoing research and investment in creditable carbon sequestration measurements, and total sequestration data will be incorporated if and when normalized and credible data emerges.

At higher levels of performance, a LMP evaluates risk and aligns to the local landscape, community, and environmental ecosystems. Effective land and forest management will also work to prevent deforestation; however, deforestation is covered in a separate indicator. Given that land functions as a container for other systems, the LMP is a valuable tool for integrating elements of intersectionality across different impact areas.

Monitoring can focus on the underlying pressures causing biodiversity loss (e.g. level of land-use change, resource exploitation, invasive species), the state of the biodiversity (e.g. the extent and condition of habitat, species distribution and abundance, water quality etc.) or the implementation of monitoring-based actions (response). When all three approaches are linked, this is known as the Pressure State, Response (PSR) framework. A key aspect of the framework is that the indicators are linked: that a recorded change in response (e.g. reduced application of herbicide) leads to a recorded change in pressure (e.g. reduced pollution) which results in a recorded change in state (e.g. improved water quality or fish populations).","This indicator examines the level of ambition that a program takes toward biodiversity as a true priority area.

In line with the ILO Code of Good Practice, PEFC requires an OHS responsible party, OHS safety training as it concerns forestry, and verification contingent on a review of the OHS system.","There is evidence that PEFC has requirements in place to address some risks related to livelihoods. In particular, PEFC requires producers to commit to improving farmer incomes towards a living income.","There is evidence that PEFC has requirements in place to address some risks related to Indigenous peoples and customary land rights. In particular, PEFC requires certified producers to respect the legal and customary land rights of Indigenous peoples where they exist, in accordance with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), and engage with all Indigenous groups affected by business operations. In addition, PEFC requires producers to assess whether customary land rights or Indigenous peoples' rights to free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) have been respected.","There is evidence that PEFC has requirements in place to address some risks related to land rights.

However, there are no explicit requirements for certified producers to take steps to address the risks of Gender-Based Violence and Harassment (GBVH).",,,"The organization released a 2030 strategy document detailing sustainability goals and plans to achieve them. The document includes measurable and time-bound targets, such as a 15% increase in PEFC-certified area by 2030. Two strategic pathways focus on improving communication and engagement to maximize awareness of the certification strategy.","The organization has a document explaining the process for standardization bodies developing, reviewing, and revising standards endorsed by PEFC. All standards undergo review and revision every five years. However, procedures for urgent changes to the international standard are not explicitly mentioned for the international standard itself. The standard development process includes public consultations. It is not mentioned what research has gone into the standard development process.","PEFC's governance structure includes the Board and General Assembly (providing strategic direction and electing the Board). The website outlines various roles and responsibilities within the management team. Membership is open to companies, organizations, and associations with shared principles, granting them voting rights in the General Assembly and the opportunity to join working groups and committees.","The organization has various documents and policies focused on claims management, also covering its different chains of custody models. Claims must align with one of the three models, and one of them requires the client organization to calculate the percentage of certified content. It has procedures and potential consequences for not adhering to logo usage rules, including financial penalties and license cancellation. Claims are solely based on content, for which guidelines are provided.","PEFC's website explains their assurance oversight approach, which involves collaborating with independent certification bodies (CBs) and accreditation bodies. The document describes the roles and responsibilities of both CBs and accreditation bodies. CBs conduct annual visits to certificate holders to ensure ongoing compliance with the standards. CBs are required to undergo initial PEFC-recognized training and periodic refresher trainings to conduct audits effectively.","Procedures exist to address major and minor non-conformities. Certified organizations are given three months to complete corrective actions for major non-conformities found during audits. In case no non-conformities were identified during an on-site audit, less stringent audit techniques like documentation and records review may be used as alternatives. There are no motivation mechanisms for certification bodies to share audit data with the standard organization in due time.","Certification bodies are required to determine their auditing sample on the basis of a risk analysis. The organization provides only a general overview of threats to forests and the industry. It does not have a risk management plan on how to identify and manage risks to the sector and organization, a risk map or overview to help certified organizations and assurance actors identify main current sector risks, or explanatory documentation for the identification and quantification of these risks.","There is a webpage for complaints and appeals, providing an email address and clear instructions. The contact page can be utilized for continuous feedback. The complaints and appeals webpage as well as a complaints management procedure clarify responsibilities for handling different types of inputs. PEFC holds public consultations not only for revisions of the standard, but also of other procedures such as Certification Body requirements.","PEFC's strategy document serves as the guide for the organization's monitoring and evaluation system. Annual Reviews report on system outputs defined in the M&E framework. The organization monitors and reviews its key performance indicators annually, which are derived from the objectives outlined in the strategy document. These indicators form the foundation of the organization's M&E framework. There is no data communication policy or procedure."
