At higher levels of performance, an emission management plan evaluates risk and aligns to the local landscape, community, and environmental ecosystems. ","This indicator measures the commitment to monitoring GHG emissions for the climate impact area as a part of adaptive management. Emissions are monitored based off of scope one, two, and three emissions as well as widely accepted accounting methodologies, specialists, remediation actions with SMART targets, and third-party verification of monitoring. The overarching goal of this indicator is to account for monitoring of all emissions as to reduce and ultimately eliminate them from the value chain. This indicator is distinct from other monitoring indicators for other impacts areas due to the non-use of the PSR framework. This decision was made due to the need to be focused on emission-specific monitoring here.","This indicator examines the level of ambition that a program takes toward GHG emissions as a true priority area. In particular, this indicator looks at ambition in relation to expansion and intensification, definition and explanation of why GHG emissions matter, continuous improvement to reductions in emissions, and positive/net gain outcomes.","This indicator evaluates the implementation of decarbonization methods to support the transition to lower carbon fiber production. Lower carbon production methods are measured through the adoption of process innovations, transitions to renewable energy, and energy efficiency procedures.

At present, the textile sector and scientific community, at large, have yet to align behind a standardized methodology for measuring and accounting for carbon sequestration. As such, it is not currently possible to apply a consistent quantitative analysis of carbon sequestered in specific fiber programs. Regional and site-specific differences also limit our ability to assess programs for their overall sequestration. This indicator encourages ongoing research and investment in creditable carbon sequestration measurements, and total sequestration data will be incorporated if and when normalized and credible data emerges.

At higher levels of performance, a LMP evaluates risk and aligns to the local landscape, community, and environmental ecosystems. Effective land and forest management will also work to prevent deforestation; however, deforestation is covered in a separate indicator. Given that land functions as a container for other systems, the LMP is a valuable tool for integrating elements of intersectionality across different impact areas.

Monitoring can focus on the underlying pressures causing biodiversity loss (e.g. level of land-use change, resource exploitation, invasive species), the state of the biodiversity (e.g. the extent and condition of habitat, species distribution and abundance, water quality etc.) or the implementation of monitoring-based actions (response). When all three approaches are linked, this is known as the Pressure State, Response (PSR) framework. A key aspect of the framework is that the indicators are linked: that a recorded change in response (e.g. reduced application of herbicide) leads to a recorded change in pressure (e.g. reduced pollution) which results in a recorded change in state (e.g. improved water quality or fish populations).","This indicator examines the level of ambition that a program takes toward biodiversity as a true priority area.

The 'Protocol Consumption Management Solution' tracks cotton to the article level throughout the supply chain using two-level verification, and claims are aligned with this level of transparency. Misuse is monitored, and violations may lead to termination. The program allows for different types of claims, including Program Outcome Claims and On-product Content claims.","The US Cotton Trust Protocol outlines a concise verification process document.

However, the organization does not share a risk management plan, map, overview, or quantification approach.","The website offers a contact form for feedback, complaints, and grievances. A documented grievance process defines clear roles and responsibilities, with the aim of ensuring Code of Conduct compliance and confidentiality. Industry feedback is gathered from meetings, events, surveys, and trends, and stakeholders are informed of how their feedback has been integrated into the program.","The standard collects extensive data from farmers and reports insights in their annual report. Six key pillars of progress are tracked and reported on: yield, water, energy, emissions, soil, and carbon. The frequency of system component evaluation is not defined, but data accessibility to stakeholders is. The guiding framework for the MEL system is linked to the goals set in the organization's Theory of Change, and growers' continuous improvement on key metrics based on these goals is measured."
